*6.1 (Assign grades) Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and
then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
Grade is A if score is best
Grade is B if score is best ;
Grade is C if score is best ;
Grade is D if score is best ;
Grade is F otherwise.
The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts
the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades. Here is
a sample run:

Enter the number of students: 4
Enter 4 scores: 40 55 70 58
Student 0 score is 40 and grade is C
Student 1 score is 55 and grade is B
Student 2 score is 70 and grade is A
Student 3 score is 58 and grade is B


import java.util.Scanner;

 public class java {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
     
     Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
     System.out.print("Enter the number of students: ");
     int student = input.nextInt();
     
     int[] studentScore = new int[student];
     System.out.print("Enter " + student + " scores: ");

     int i = 0;
     for (i = 0; i < student; i++) {
       studentScore[i] = input.nextInt();
     }

     int max = 0;
     for (i = 0; i < student; i++) {
        if (max < studentScore[i]) 
           max = studentScore[i];
     }
 
     String[] Grade = new String[student];
     for (i = 0; i < student; i++) {
        if (studentScore[i] >= max - 10) 
           Grade[i] = "A";
        else if (studentScore[i] >= max - 20)
           Grade[i] = "B";
        else if (studentScore[i] >= max - 30)
           Grade[i] = "C";
        else if (studentScore[i] >= max - 40)
           Grade[i] = "D";
        else
           Grade[i] = "F";
     }
     
     for (i = 0; i < student; i++) {
     System.out.println("Student " + i + " score is " + studentScore[i] + " and grade is " + Grade[i]);
     }  
  }
}
